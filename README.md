# Order Processing System – Design Overview

## Purpose

This system processes order files, validates their contents, and integrates with external systems (ERP, order management, email notifications?). It is designed for extensibility, maintainability, and testability using modern .NET practices.

---

## Architecture

### 1. Layered Structure

- **Models**: Represent business entities (`Order`, `Article`).
- **Services**: Contain business logic (`OrderService` for processing orders).
- **Repositories**: Abstract data access (price reference, erp).
- **Providers**: Integrate with external systems (`OrderManagementSystemProvider`).
- **Validators**: Use FluentValidation to enforce business rules.

### 2. Dependency Injection

- All services, repositories, and validators are registered with the .NET DI container.
- Constructor injection is used for dependencies, promoting testability and loose coupling.

## Key Components

### OrderService

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Parse order files.
  - Validate orders and articles using FluentValidation.
  - Validate price references.
  - Send notifications (email) on specific events.
  - Integrate with external order management systems.

### Validation

- **OrderValidator** and **ArticleValidator** enforce business rules.
- Unit tests (using xUnit and FluentValidation.TestHelper) ensure validation logic correctness.

### Notification

- `SendNotification` in `OrderService` sends email notifications using `SmtpClient`.
- SMTP settings are configurable for different environments.

### External Integration

- `OrderManagementSystemProvider` serializes orders to XML and sends them via HTTP POST to external APIs.
- Uses `HttpClient` for HTTP communication and `XmlSerializer` for XML serialization.

---

## Extensibility & Testability

- **Interfaces** are used for all major components, enabling mocking and easy replacement.
- **Unit tests** cover validation and business logic.
- **Configuration** (e.g., SMTP, API URLs) is externalized via `appsettings.json`.

---

## Example Flow

1. **Startup**: Services and dependencies are registered.
2. **Order Processing**:
   - Files are read from a configured directory.
   - Each file is parsed into an `Order`.
   - The order is validated; errors are logged and notified.
   - Price references are checked and updated if needed.
   - The order is sent to the external management system.
3. **Notification**: Any issues or important changes trigger an email notification.

---

## Technology Stack

- **.NET 8**, C# 12
- **FluentValidation** for validation
- **System.Net.Mail** for email
- **System.Xml.Serialization** for XML
- **HttpClient** for HTTP integration
- **xUnit** for testing

---

## Future Enhancements

- Create custom exception to granularly handle errors in order processing.
- Implement a proper storage for orders (blob?)
- Add logging and monitoring for observability (nlog?). Define a context, a correlation Id for tracking requests.
- Consider a more domain oriented architecture in case this functionality expands, especially for additional flows.
- Add more unit tests to cover service paths, and integration tests once external systems are available.
- Create predefined embedded resources for test inputs instead of creating files on the fly.
- Define a build process to define required artifacts.

## Summary

This system is designed for robust, maintainable order processing with clear separation of concerns, strong validation, and easy integration with external systems. The use of modern .NET features and best practices ensures it is ready for future growth and adaptation.
